## INTRODUCTION.  
 --- 

  - You are required to create a mini app, `Flatacuties`, where you can vote for the cutest animal!  
  - You will use a local API and build out the frontend for our app.

### DESCRIPTION .     
 ----   
  - This project is a web application designed for users to cast their votes for preferred pets. It showcases a collection of pet cards that exhibit the pet's name, image, vote count, and a button to increment the vote count. By clicking on an pet's name, users can access additional details about that specific animal.   

- The application employs JavaScript to interact with a RESTful API for data retrieval and updates. It utilizes the Fetch API to execute HTTP requests to communicate with the backend server. The server acts as a storage for pet data and offers endpoints to retrieve all pets, update vote counts, and reset vote counts.


- The frontend consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes DOM manipulation to dynamically generate the pet cards and handle user interactions like voting and resetting vote counts. Event listeners are attached to the vote and reset buttons to trigger the corresponding actions.


 

### REQUIREMENTS.
